                    Welcome to the JWST Fanpage! <br>
                    My goal for this website is to show off a selection of handpicked pictures <br>
                    from the James Webb Space Telescope and get more eyes on it. <br>
                    This front page shows off a recent image from the telescope <br>
                    that I found to be very interesting.

            <h2>JuMBOs = "Jupiter Mass Binary Objects"</h2>
            <article class="flex-container">
                <p id="featured-text">
                    Our current featured image showcases a potentially new astronomical phenomena! <br>
                    Within the new images taken of the Orion nebula,
                    it is possible to find Jupiter sized binary objects that are currently interstellar. <br>
                    This new phenomenon has scientists and astronomers scratching their heads. <br>
                    <br>
                    JuMBOs are fascinating because as previously described, they are apparently interstellar objects. <br>
                    What does "interstellar" mean in this context? 
                    It means that they are rogue planets that are not tied to a star like the planets within our solar system. <br>
                    The reason that this is fascinating is due to the fact that scientists only believed this was possible with a single planet. <br>
                    Not binary planets! Not to mention these binary planets are ALSO around the size of Jupiter. <br>
                    <br>
                    This image located on the right is showcased in the new scientific article by Samuel G. Pearson & Mark J. McCaughrean. <br>
                    Check out the link below in the footer and click on the second paper, that one talks about JuMBOs.
